### Developing

This is a GitHub page running Jekyll! Read about the ruby gem [here](https://github.com/github/pages-gem).

Make sure you've got ruby and Bundler up and running, then it's just a matter of installing the gems:

```sh
$ bundle install
```

After the gems are installed you can build the site with `jekyll build` or serve it locally with `jekyll serve`.
