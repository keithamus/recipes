recipeInstructions:

    ingredients: olive oil, garlic
    time: PT2M
  - instruction: Add the kale pieces and a good grind of black pepper, then continue to sauté, stirring frequently. If you want a little bit of heat add a sprinkle of chili flakes at this stage.
    time: PT5M
    ingredients: kale, black pepper, chili flakes
  - instruction: While the kale is cooking, blend the cashews with the ¼ teaspoon salt and water until completely smooth. 
    ingredients: cashews, salt, water
    time: PT3M
  - instruction: Add the gnocchi to the boiling water. Make sure to separate each piece of gnocchi before adding it to the water. Often they get a little clumped together in the pack. Have a slotted spoon ready to fish them out when done.
    ingredients: gnocchi, water
    time: PT2M
  - instruction: As soon as the gnocchi start to float, use a slotted spoon to remove them (do not discard the water) and add the gnocchi into the pan with the kale and garlic. 
  - instruction: Spoon the creamy cashew sauce into the pan and stir to combine everything. Add a little of the water the gnocchi was cooking in to thin it out a little as needed and add more seasoning if desired.
