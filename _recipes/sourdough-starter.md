notes:
  - It's a good idea to mark the weight of the jar on the side, to help when discarding excess starter.
  - This is a "100% hydration" starter; be sure to use it in recipes that call for a 100% starter.
  - You can slow down the culture by refridgerating it. A refridgerated starter
    will only need to be fed weekly. Remove it from the refridgerator and let
    it come to room temperature before feeding, and leave it at room
    temperature for 24 hours.
  - Experiment with flour combinations - for example a 50/50 mix of plain/rye flour works well.
