notes:
 - If you want to make it spicier, simply add more chillies! One chilli will suit most palate.
 - For a green thai curry paste, add some basil leaves - one or two leaves will do.
 - For a red thai curry paste, add plenty of red birds eye chillies - 6g (3 chillies) would be a good starting point.
 - For a yellow thai curry paste, forgo the lime leaf and coriander, and add 3g (1tsp) turmeric, 3g (1tsp) cinnamon, and
   2g (1tsp) ground white pepper - adding them in the last step.
 - The salt, coriander seeds and cumin all act as abbrasives, to help the pestle & mortar produce a more even paste.
 - If you want to make a vegan alternative to this, substitute anchovies for 17g (1tbsp) brown/red miso paste,
   and fish sauce for [this vegan fish sauce alternative recipe](/recipes/vegan-fish-sacue-alternative).
