As someone hailing from the little island of the UK, I practically grew up on Gin, specifically paired with tonic. It wasn't until late 20s that I discovered the wonder of the Collins, a _classic_ cocktail - dating back to the 1870s. Simple in execution, a Collins is just a mixture of Syrup, Gin, Lemon and Soda - turning the crisp, dry flavour of Gin into a smooth and refreshing sweet & sour drink.

While it is not _the_ oldest cocktail (an award which, with much contention, likely goes to the 1850's [Sazerac](/recipes/sazerac)) it is certainly in the top 10. The recipe has changed slightly over time - the original calling for a dash of lemon with an entire wine glass of gin. These days the most common recipe is as simple as 1-2-3: 1 parts lemon juice, 2 parts simple syrup, 3 parts gin; top the glass with soda, and enjoy. If you have the luxury of having some sour mix on hand, just replace the lemon juice and simple syrup - equal quantities will do. With such a simple set of ingredients - staple parts of any worthy bar - it's difficult to find a reason _not_ to make this fantastic cocktail. Of course, such an old recipe now also has many derivates - and so if you find yourself without a good Gin, then reach for the Tequilla and make a Juan Collins instead, or maybe a John Collins with Whiskey; if you're the type of person who enjoys sipping a Jagermeister, rather than ruining your beer with it - then a Russell Collins could be right up your alley.

A collins is best served in its namesake glass - a collins glass, part of the joy of the collins is watching the bubbles dance up the side of the glass, telling your tongue to prepare itself for the citrus, the fizz and that unique gin flavour. A slice of lemon sitting on the edge, reminding you of the sun sitting on the horizon gives you all of the timeless visual appeal that a cocktail needs.

This recipe just shoots for the most classic Collins. The recipe isn't pulling anything interesting - it's just a solid basis for the Collins - where it gets fun is what you do with it after that.

Practice making a perfect collins and you'll have a good basis for a slew of it's cousin cocktails - what I like to call the ["syrup, citrus & spirit"](/tags/syrup-citrus-spirit) group of cocktails. Perhaps closest is a "Gin Fizz" which is shaken not stirred, into an empty rocks glass, not a collins filled with ice. Arguably the most famous relative is the [Mojito](/recipes/mojito) which could be described as a "Ron Collins with Mint". On the short side, the [Gimlet](/recipes/gimlet) is pretty much a Collins without the soda in a martini glass, take that [Gimlet](/recipes/gimlet) and add some mint and you've got a [Southside](/recipes/southside).

Of course, like any cocktail, feel free to experiment with adding some extras to this one. Try using lime juice instead of lemon, add some egg whites, angostura, maybe slide in an extra couple of maraschino cherries - or use maraschino cherry syrup in place of the simple syrup. A mint leaf adds a great bit of aroma and zest, or some cucumber slices for some extra smoothness. Try some different gins, find your favourite, I'm partial to Hendricks, or London Dry Gin.
